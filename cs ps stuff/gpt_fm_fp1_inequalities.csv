What is a polynomial inequality?,"A mathematical expression where a polynomial is set greater than, less than, or equal to zero, e.g., f(x) > 0."
How do you solve a polynomial inequality?,"1. Factorise the polynomial. 2. Find critical values (roots). 3. Use a sign diagram or number line. 4. Test intervals. 5. Determine solution set."
What does 'strict inequality' mean?,"An inequality using < or > (not including the boundary points)."
What does 'non-strict inequality' mean?,"An inequality using ≤ or ≥ (including the boundary points)."
What must you do when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number?,"You must reverse the inequality sign."
How are inequalities involving rational expressions solved?,"1. Move all terms to one side. 2. Find critical values from numerator and denominator. 3. Use a sign diagram. 4. Exclude values where denominator = 0."
What are critical points in an inequality?,"The values of x where the expression equals zero or is undefined."
When solving inequalities with rational expressions, what values must be excluded?,"Values that make the denominator zero."
What is a sign diagram?,"A number line divided at critical points, with each interval tested to determine the sign (+/-) of the expression."
Why is interval testing important in inequalities?,"It determines where the expression is positive or negative between critical points."
In inequalities, when is the expression > 0?,"When the expression is positive (choose intervals where result is positive)."
In inequalities, when is the expression < 0?,"When the expression is negative (choose intervals where result is negative)."
What is the domain of a rational inequality?,"All real x except values where the denominator is zero."
When graphing inequalities, how is a strict inequality shown on a number line?,"With open circles at endpoints and shaded regions for valid intervals."
When graphing inequalities, how is a non-strict inequality shown?,"With closed circles at endpoints and shaded regions for valid intervals."
What are the steps to solve |f(x)| < a type inequalities?,"Solve compound inequality: –a < f(x) < a."
How do you solve |f(x)| > a type inequalities?,"Solve f(x) < –a or f(x) > a."
How do you represent the solution to an inequality graphically?,"On a number line or coordinate plane, showing valid regions."
What should you always check when solving inequalities involving quadratics or rationals?,"1. Factorisation. 2. Sign change around roots. 3. Domain restrictions."
Can inequalities have multiple disjoint solution intervals?,"Yes. Especially with rational or modulus inequalities. Always test each region."
What does solving inequalities 'algebraically' mean?,"Using symbolic manipulation rather than graphical or numerical methods."
What is the significance of equality in inequalities?,"The equality (≤ or ≥) includes boundary points; strict ones (< or >) exclude them."
When must modulus inequalities be split into cases?,"Always – due to the piecewise definition of |x|: it's x if x ≥ 0 and –x if x < 0."
