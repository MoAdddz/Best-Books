"What is systems software?","Software that manages hardware and runs application software (e.g., OS, utilities)."
"What are the two main types of systems software?","Operating systems and utility programs."
"What is an operating system?","Software that manages hardware resources and provides services to programs and users."
"Four main functions of an OS?","Memory management, processor scheduling, I/O handling, file management."
"What is memory management?","Controls allocation of RAM to processes; uses paging, segmentation, virtual memory."
"What is paging?","Divides memory into fixed-size blocks (pages); allows non-contiguous storage; supports virtual memory."
"✅/❌ Paging","✅ Simple, supports virtual memory / ❌ Slower access, may split instructions across pages."
"What is segmentation?","Divides memory into logical variable-sized blocks (e.g., code/data/stack)."
"✅/❌ Segmentation","✅ Logical organisation, easier to load/unload / ❌ Fragmentation risk, complex to manage."
"What is virtual memory?","Uses secondary storage as additional RAM when physical memory is full."
"✅/❌ Virtual memory","✅ Prevents crashes, allows multitasking / ❌ Slow, can cause disk thrashing."
"What is processor scheduling?","Determines order and timing of process execution to maximise CPU efficiency."
"What is round-robin scheduling?","Gives each process equal CPU time in a circular order."
"✅/❌ Round-robin","✅ Fair, avoids starvation / ❌ Overhead from frequent context switching."
"What is FCFS scheduling?","First Come First Served: processes run in order of arrival."
"✅/❌ FCFS","✅ Simple / ❌ Long jobs delay short ones (convoy effect)."
"What is Shortest Job First (SJF)?","Executes the process with the shortest estimated runtime first."
"✅/❌ SJF","✅ Efficient, reduces average wait / ❌ Requires knowledge of job lengths, may starve long jobs."
"What is Multi-Level Feedback Queue?","Multiple queues with different priorities; jobs can move between them."
"✅/❌ MLFQ","✅ Adapts to job behaviour / ❌ Complex to tune and manage."
"What is Shortest Remaining Time?","Chooses process with least time left to complete; pre-emptive version of SJF."
"✅/❌ Shortest Remaining Time","✅ Very efficient / ❌ High overhead, complex to predict time remaining."
"What is an interrupt?","A signal to the CPU to pause current task and run an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)."
"What is an ISR?","Interrupt Service Routine: handles specific interrupt before returning to main process."
"What is context switching?","Saving and loading of process state to switch between tasks."
"What is file management?","OS handles organisation, storage, retrieval, and permissions of files."
"✅/❌ File management","✅ Organises data, enables access control / ❌ Can be complex and vulnerable to corruption."
"What is I/O management?","Coordinates communication between CPU and peripherals using drivers and buffers."
"What is a device driver?","Translates OS commands into device-specific instructions."
"✅/❌ Device driver","✅ Enables hardware communication / ❌ Incorrect drivers cause errors."
"What is a buffer?","Temporary storage area that handles data transfers between devices at different speeds."
"What is utility software?","System tools that maintain or improve performance (e.g., antivirus, defrag, backup)."
"Examples of utility programs?","Disk defragmenter, backup tool, antivirus, compression tool."
"What is disk defragmentation?","Reorganises fragmented files so blocks are contiguous."
"✅/❌ Disk defrag","✅ Speeds up file access / ❌ Takes time, unnecessary for SSDs."
"What is file compression?","Reduces file size using lossless or lossy algorithms."
"✅/❌ Compression","✅ Saves space, faster transfer / ❌ Slower access, CPU usage."
"What is backup software?","Creates copies of files for recovery after data loss."
"What is full backup?","Copies all files each time."
"✅/❌ Full backup","✅ Easy to restore / ❌ Time-consuming, large storage."
"What is incremental backup?","Only backs up files changed since last backup."
"✅/❌ Incremental backup","✅ Fast, efficient / ❌ Slower restore, needs multiple backups."
"What is open source software?","Software with source code available for use, modification, and distribution."
"✅/❌ Open source","✅ Free, transparent, community support / ❌ Less formal support, fragmented."
"What is closed source software?","Proprietary software with restricted access to source code."
"✅/❌ Closed source","✅ Supported, secure / ❌ Not customisable, costly."
"What are the types of operating system?","Distributed, Embedded, Multi-tasking, Multi-user, Real-time."
"What is a distributed OS?","Runs across multiple machines, appearing as a single system."
"✅/❌ Distributed OS","✅ Scalable, load-balanced / ❌ Complex setup, network dependency."
"What is an embedded OS?","Built into devices with dedicated functions (e.g., washing machines)."
"✅/❌ Embedded OS","✅ Reliable, efficient / ❌ Limited functionality, hard to update."
"What is a multi-tasking OS?","Runs multiple applications simultaneously on one CPU."
"✅/❌ Multi-tasking OS","✅ Efficient use of CPU / ❌ May cause lag if overloaded."
"What is a multi-user OS?","Allows many users to share system resources concurrently."
"✅/❌ Multi-user OS","✅ Centralised resources / ❌ Needs robust security and scheduling."
"What is a real-time OS?","Responds to inputs within strict time constraints (e.g., airbag systems)."
"✅/❌ Real-time OS","✅ Predictable, fast / ❌ Expensive, complex to build."
"What is BIOS?","Basic Input/Output System: runs POST and starts the boot process."
"What is POST?","Power-On Self-Test: checks hardware before OS loads."
"✅/❌ BIOS","✅ Ensures system readiness / ❌ Can be outdated or vulnerable."
"What is a virtual machine?","Software that emulates a computer system; used to run OSes or intermediate code."
"✅/❌ Virtual machine","✅ Runs multiple OS, sandboxing / ❌ Overhead, slower than native execution."
"What is intermediate code?","Platform-independent code (e.g., bytecode) run by a virtual machine."
"✅/❌ Intermediate code","✅ Portable, partially secure / ❌ Needs interpreter, slower."
